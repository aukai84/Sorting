# Sorting Algorithms

We will be implementing the five sorting algorithms we learned in class (`bubble`, `insertion`, `selection`, `quick`, `merge`).
Below are some instructions and tips on how to implement these algorithms...

> ## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is one first sorting algorithms taught when a student is learning sorting algorithms.  It is a simple algorithm to implement at the cost of speed.  Basically, bubble sort first compares adjacent items in a list of numbers, and swaps them if they are out of order.  At the end of comparing each adjacent item in the list, if the list is not sorted, the algorithm will run through the list again and compare each adjacent item and swap them if they are out of order.  This continues until the list is sorted.
